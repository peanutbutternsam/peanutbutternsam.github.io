					My thinking style is abstract random. After researching I learned a lot more about this style of learning. 30% of the general population falls into this category. I also researched the Gregorc model to learn more about its purpose and better understand the different learning styles aside from my own. The purpose of the Gregorc model is to reveal ones perception and ordering abilities. Perceptual abilities define the way ones information is grasped. Ordering abilities define the way a learner organizes information. It turns out that while everyone has all four qualities defined within the Gregorc model, each individual has a predisposition for one type or another. Those with my learning predisposition, aka AR, learn best through television, movies, assignments with reflection time, and group discussions. 
					<br>
					<br>

					I tend to like the following: Cooperative work, Assignments with room for interpretation, Balance of social activities and work, Noncompetitive atmospheres, Personalized learning, Personal attention and emotional support.

					<br>
					<br>

					I tend to struggle with the following: Working alone, Attending to details and giving exact answers, Working within time limits, Concentrating on one task at a time, Being corrected, Expecting less emotional response from others
					
					<br>
					<br>

					AR mind style characteristics: Dislikes routine procedures and orderliness, Is extremely sensitive to his/her own and others' feelings, Is flexible, accepting and responds easily to change, Learns well through discussion and sharing of ideas, Is imaginative, Personalizes information, Is usually involved in many projects or interest at one time, Is focused on friends and relationships, Has a fear of not being liked.
					
					<br>
					<br>

					I think that knowing this information can be used to my advantage and help me progress through information and assignments quicker and more effectively. From this information I see that it is important for me to collaborate with others and reach out for help and personal attention when I feel I am not grasping something. It may even be beneficial to me to schedule more than the required number of pairing sessions per week. 
					
					<br>
					<br>

					My biggest struggle so far has been the solo challenges. Although I like the assignments outlined in the solo challenges, I often stall and get drained of energy quicker when approaching these challenges. I often find myself wanting to reach out to other students to get feedback and input as I am working, but know that this is not allowed for these specific challenges. My biggest struggle is related to my learning style, I think something I could do to help this struggle is to complete my solo challenge then ask for feedback from other students afterwords that I can incorporate into my project later on. 

					<br>
					<br>
					
					In regards to the growth vs. fixed mindset article, I definitely found that I have a growth mindset and am willing to change, adapt, and develop my intelligence through hard work, curiousity, and effort.
					I really liked the quote in this article, said by a 7th grader: 

					<br>
					<br>
					
					"I think intelligence is something you have to work for … it isn’t just given to you.… Most kids, if they’re not sure of an answer, will not raise their hand to answer the question. But what I usually do is raise my hand, because if I’m wrong, then my mistake will be corrected. Or I will raise my hand and say, ‘How would this be solved?’ or ‘I don’t get this. Can you help me?’ Just by doing that I’m increasing my intelligence." 

					<br>
					<br>
					
					This resonates with me because I was very shy growing up in school and was often afraid to speak up in front of the class, although I did believe I was missing out on learning because I was too shy to ask questions. I am comfortable asking questions in small groups of people and think that I benefit a lot from learning from others, and the things I learn from other people rather than individually typically stick in my memory better.

					<br>
					<br>
					
					Overall, I find it to be really helpful to better understand my learning style and ways that I can enhance my learning. It will also help me to motivate myself to improve on my areas of weakness.

					Based on the video, my take on the DBC experience is that it will be an awesome learning environment. DBC seems to be the exact opposite of the traditional education system which revolves around extensive amounts of memorization and regurgitation. I like the experimentation mind set and think I will work well in this environment. I'm excited to work in a collaborative learning environment where I can bounce ideas around with some really smart people everyday for 9 weeks. Being surrounded by others who are really excited to learn and grow as developers will keep me motivated and inspired throughout the process and I feel lucky that I get to be a part of DBC.
