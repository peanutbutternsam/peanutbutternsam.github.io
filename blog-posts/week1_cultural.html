					<h2 id="entry-title">Stereotype Threat</h2>
					<h2 id="entry-date">Aug 22nd</h2>
				</div>
				<p class="blog-entry">
					This was my first time reading about stereotype threat, and I can say I was pretty unaware of the effects of it. As a white female, I can't say that I have really felt any fears being a minority in many settings - I previously worked in the male dominated finance world, and will soon be working in the male dominated tech world. Keeping that in mind, this hasn't really been an issue for me as I never thought myself to be inferior due to my sex or had any insecurities about it. In situations where others may have made remarks or suggestions about this matter, I have never taken it to heart or let it bother me. I myself don't think of people of any kind as being superior or inferior to another based on race, gender, or ethnicity. I cannot speak for people of other minority groups or racial groups that may have different experiences from me. I can imagine that this may be an issue for other groups and based on different upbringings, social settings, and general surroundings, many groups may have been treated in ways that made them think others viewed them as inferior. And I imagine that in this situation it would be difficult to break out of these thoughts if one had been exposed to this repeatedly throughout their life. That being said, I think it is a shame that all people cannot see that everyone is on the same level, and can reach the same level of achievement. I think it is important to be sensitive to those with different cultures and backgrounds from my own and make sure that anyone I come acrossed feels comfortable collaborating with me, as I believe that everyone is just as capable as I am.

					<br>
					<br>
					If ever I am in a situation where I sense that someone feels this way or is suffering from stereotype threat, I will encourage them and help them feel more comfortable in their surroundings so they do not feel they are being judged for any reason. I think in a learning or working environment, to ensure I am making others feel comfortable around me, I will ask for their feedback about their experience with me. 

					<br>
					<br>

					To help alieviate this situation and make others around me feel comfortable and capable, I will be sensitive to those that I am working with and treat them with care, respect, and consideration.

					<h2 id="entry-title">Pairing & Feedback</h2>
					<h2 id="entry-date">Aug 13th</h2>
				</div>
				<p class="blog-entry">
					- What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?
	#Pairing with others to solve challenges is actually more effective for me than when I work solo. I have found that in working with others, I get a better grasp of the material. If the other pair knows more, they have helped me get up to speed. If I know more during a session, I benefit a lot from explaining the concepts to my pair as it helps me to solidify my learnings by being forced to fully understand my thought processes.
- Was something particularly fun or rewarding?
	#Something particularly fun is when both my pair and I are stuck on something, neither of us can figure it out, that is the point where I have experienced the most collaboration, deep thought, and strategizing in order to solve the problem at hand. In the moments I have experienced this, my pair(s) and I have really overcome some hurdles, and these are the challenges I have learned from and retained information from the most.

- Was something frustrating and difficult for you?
	#Sometimes it can be frustrating if your pair knows more about a topic than you do but they are not as talkative or communicative in explaining the work they have implemented. This can be very frustrating because it forces you to go on after the session and try to wrap your head around some code you don't necessarily understand but have implemented in your solution that you will be submitting. I have found that this scenario requires about two extra hours of research to make sure you are confident with what the code is doing.

#### Feedback
- How did you feel when you read your feedback? 
	#I was a little nervous at first to read my feedback, not knowing how I was doing or if I was collaborating up to everyone's standards, but after reading the feedback I have become more comfortable with it. The feedback has overall been really positive and constructive for me to use in improving myself and the way in which I work with others.

- Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?
	#The feedback is very helpful. I think it makes me more aware of myself when collaborating. Sometimes I will notice I am getting to caught up in my own head thinking about how to approach a challenge. This is something I have noticed in my feedback, so now when I am pairing, I try to catch myself when I start doing this. Ultimately it makes me a better communicator if I can get into a habit of thinking out loud and making sure my pair is on the same page as me.

- Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to 
do to improve next time you pair?
	#Based on the feedback I have received, I am going to continue to try and be more verbal and make sure I am expressing myself in a clear and concise way. I have found that asking my pair during the session if I am communicating enough and if they are understanding what I am thinking has been very helpful. Doing this has given me instant feedback and hopefully has made my pairing sessions more comfortable for my pairs.
- How was it to write feedback? 
	#Writing feedback it tough. It is hard to point out one specific thing to constructively criticize about my pairs because usually my sessions go really well and I don't have any complaints. I have instead tried to look for feedback that can help them learn more effectively, whether it be a weakness in terms of coding that I notice, or lack of communication. This has become easier for me than it was in the intial weeks because I have seen how helpful the feedback has been for me and it motivates me to give the other boots the best and most helpful feedback I can to help them continuously grow and improve.

- What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?
	#The most difficult thing for me at first was wording my feedback in a way to make it easier received by my pair. Making sure the feedback follows the guidelines of being specific, actionable, and kind. I think being specific has been the most difficult for me.

Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?
	#I think pairing is definitely a big plus for me. Every week I at first get a little stressed out trying to plan pairing sessions and make sure they fit into my schedule, but after each pairing session I am reminded that it is well worth it and really helps me learn faster and more effectively. I think the scheduling issue will dissipate for me once we are in person at DBC and I will be able to focus purely on the benefits and fun I have when collaborating with others. The feedback has also been really great for me overall. It is especially encouraging when I read feedback about something I did to help someone solidify a concept. I think both the positive feedback and constructive feedback have both been a very positive part of my learning experience thus so far at DBC.

					<h2 id="entry-title">Tech Industry Issues</h2>
					<h2 id="entry-date">Aug 7th</h2>
				</div>
				<p class="blog-entry">
					An issue in the tech industry that I've been finding interesting as I learn how to test my code is that new technologies are often released faster than they can be thoroughly tested. Consumers demand to get new products and market competitors have to implement software faster than their competitors to stay on top of the market. At the same time, consumers don't want to deal with  faulty software with bugs. Often times producers will get through the testing cylce more quickly than they should failing to ensure at least most of the bugs are out of the product, and the product ultimately gets shipped. With such quick release cycles, it seems that there are continuous bugs, and right after one release, engineers move on to create the next product that will be released. Software testing is something that in my opinion is really important. It helps improve the quality, reliability, and performance to see if it is behaving the way it was intended to. So why is testing so important and what happens when thorough testing is not used in the development cycle? If testing does not take place at early stages, and a bug makes it through to the final stages of the development process, it can become increasingly expensive to fix. It requires more research, more time, and engineers which ultimately equates to more money being thrown at the problem. The second thing to take into consideration is that without testing the product extensively, users will not experience ease of use.

					<br>
					<br>

					To solve these problems, I think it is important for developers and engineers to test their code and participate in test-driven development which is a software development process that relies on the repitition of a very short development cycle.

					<br>
					<br>

					This requires the developer to follow several steps which go as follows: 
					
					<br>
					<br>
					1. Add a test: This test must inevitably fail because it is written before the feature has been implemented.
					<br>
					<br>
					2. Run all tests and see if the new one fails: This step validates that the tests harness is working appropriately and that it doesn't mistakenly pass without requiring any new code.
					<br>
					<br>
					3. Write some code: Now you write some code the causes your new test to pass. Code at this stage is not likely to be perfect, but will still pass the tests. The process allows for this because later steps in the process ensure the code meets higher standards.
					<br>
					<br>
					4. Run tests: If all of the tester code passes this step, the developer can be fairly confident that the code is meeting the requirements defined within the tests.
					<br>
					<br>
					5. Refactor code: This is the developers opportunity and responsibility to clean up their code as much as necessary so that others can navigate and build from their code with ease. A part of this step is to re-run this code through your tests to ensure that you have not manipulated it too far to where it no longer functions.

					<h2 id="entry-title">Abstract Random</h2>
					<h2 id="entry-date">Aug 5th</h2>
				</div>
				<p class="blog-entry">
					My thinking style is abstract random. After researching I learned a lot more about this style of learning. 30% of the general population falls into this category. I also researched the Gregorc model to learn more about its purpose and better understand the different learning styles aside from my own. The purpose of the Gregorc model is to reveal ones perception and ordering abilities. Perceptual abilities define the way ones information is grasped. Ordering abilities define the way a learner organizes information. It turns out that while everyone has all four qualities defined within the Gregorc model, each individual has a predisposition for one type or another. Those with my learning predisposition, aka AR, learn best through television, movies, assignments with reflection time, and group discussions. 
					<br>
					<br>

					I tend to like the following: Cooperative work, Assignments with room for interpretation, Balance of social activities and work, Noncompetitive atmospheres, Personalized learning, Personal attention and emotional support.

					<br>
					<br>

					I tend to struggle with the following: Working alone, Attending to details and giving exact answers, Working within time limits, Concentrating on one task at a time, Being corrected, Expecting less emotional response from others
					
					<br>
					<br>

					AR mind style characteristics: Dislikes routine procedures and orderliness, Is extremely sensitive to his/her own and others' feelings, Is flexible, accepting and responds easily to change, Learns well through discussion and sharing of ideas, Is imaginative, Personalizes information, Is usually involved in many projects or interest at one time, Is focused on friends and relationships, Has a fear of not being liked.
					
					<br>
					<br>

					I think that knowing this information can be used to my advantage and help me progress through information and assignments quicker and more effectively. From this information I see that it is important for me to collaborate with others and reach out for help and personal attention when I feel I am not grasping something. It may even be beneficial to me to schedule more than the required number of pairing sessions per week. 
					
					<br>
					<br>

					My biggest struggle so far has been the solo challenges. Although I like the assignments outlined in the solo challenges, I often stall and get drained of energy quicker when approaching these challenges. I often find myself wanting to reach out to other students to get feedback and input as I am working, but know that this is not allowed for these specific challenges. My biggest struggle is related to my learning style, I think something I could do to help this struggle is to complete my solo challenge then ask for feedback from other students afterwords that I can incorporate into my project later on. 

					<br>
					<br>
					
					In regards to the growth vs. fixed mindset article, I definitely found that I have a growth mindset and am willing to change, adapt, and develop my intelligence through hard work, curiousity, and effort.
					I really liked the quote in this article, said by a 7th grader: 

					<br>
					<br>
					
					"I think intelligence is something you have to work for … it isn’t just given to you.… Most kids, if they’re not sure of an answer, will not raise their hand to answer the question. But what I usually do is raise my hand, because if I’m wrong, then my mistake will be corrected. Or I will raise my hand and say, ‘How would this be solved?’ or ‘I don’t get this. Can you help me?’ Just by doing that I’m increasing my intelligence." 

					<br>
					<br>
					
					This resonates with me because I was very shy growing up in school and was often afraid to speak up in front of the class, although I did believe I was missing out on learning because I was too shy to ask questions. I am comfortable asking questions in small groups of people and think that I benefit a lot from learning from others, and the things I learn from other people rather than individually typically stick in my memory better.

					<br>
					<br>
					
					Overall, I find it to be really helpful to better understand my learning style and ways that I can enhance my learning. It will also help me to motivate myself to improve on my areas of weakness.

					<h2 id="entry-title">DBC Experience</h2>
					<h2 id="entry-date">July 19th</h2>
				</div>
				<p class="blog-entry">
					Based on the video, my take on the DBC experience is that it will be an awesome learning environment. DBC seems to be the exact opposite of the traditional education system which revolves around extensive amounts of memorization and regurgitation. I like the experimentation mind set and think I will work well in this environment. I'm excited to work in a collaborative learning environment where I can bounce ideas around with some really smart people everyday for 9 weeks. Being surrounded by others who are really excited to learn and grow as developers will keep me motivated and inspired throughout the process and I feel lucky that I get to be a part of DBC.
