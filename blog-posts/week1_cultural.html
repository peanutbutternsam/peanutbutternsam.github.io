					Based on the video, my take on the DBC experience is that it will be an awesome learning environment. DBC seems to be the exact opposite of the traditional education system which revolves around extensive amounts of memorization and regurgitation. I like the experimentation mind set and think I will work well in this environment. I'm excited to work in a collaborative learning environment where I can bounce ideas around with some really smart people everyday for 9 weeks. Being surrounded by others who are really excited to learn and grow as developers will keep me motivated and inspired throughout the process and I feel lucky that I get to be a part of DBC.
