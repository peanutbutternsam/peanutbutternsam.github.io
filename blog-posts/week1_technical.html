					I think this site is very visually appealing. You can immediately figure out what their product offering is and how it works. The website uses few words to explain the product and makes its functionality more intuitive. When I first look at the site, my eye is drawn to the video in the center of the page, which shows how the product works. When stepping back, I notice the background image of the site. I think the video being in the center of the page is very effective in helping the company achieve their main goal, which is getting the user to buy their product. Instead of trying to convince you of the product by making you read about it, you can watch how convenient it can make your life by watching the video. I think the most important part of the page is the interactivity that occurs when you scroll down the page. This website and product solves the problem that people have relating to the clutter of things that everyone needs to carry around such as -- keys, sunglasses, credit cards, cash, etc. Their product compacts your money into one place so you have a couple things less to keep track of and worry about. The content of this page demonstrates the solution very clearly and creatively. One of my favorite parts about the page is the bright coloring that tells a story in a way along with pictures and moving images. I like the section that shows four credit cards being combined into one, this really emphasizes how useful their product is. By looking at the homepage you can immediately find content and information about the product you were looking for. You can also see the pre-order now button at the top of the page, and various spots throughout the page. If you are heading to the page to buy the product immediately, this can be easily done. Browsing through the content of the site is the best part of this site, it is very interactive and fun to scroll through and see how the product works. I like that I wasn't forced to read through block text to figure out what the product can do for me. This is not really a site you can spend a lot of time on because you quickly figure out its purpose. I would not get bored on this site. Looking at it is an enjoyable experience. The site sells a credit card that can hold all of your credit cards in one single card. Yes, I pre-ordered the product, they got me.

					Spotify uses parallax design on their site creating a 3D-like depth effect. While scrolling through the page, the user gains contol over the movement of multiple layers of information on the page. The page toggles between showing images and information, but this only occurs at the speed the user moves their fingers across the scroll pad. In terms of user design, this site does a great job at drawing users into the site and making the page more interactive. This is also an advantage for them because it makes the information they are showing seem more like a story, and thus makes them browse the site longer to see how it works. I think it also shows the users what they should be doing next in an intuitive way. They start at the top of the page and by the time they have hints about what the company's product is, they get to the bottom that has download options for site users who want to see what else the company has to offer. The strongest adjective I could give this site would be "cool", but I would also call it interactive, elegant, complex, and fun.
