	What problem is this site solving?
	This site makes it easy for comic lovers to quickly browse and buy the comic they want. The website layout is visually appealing and well organized. I think the biggest challenge for the compnay was to decide the order and placement of the content in order to best grab the attention of buyers and help them find what they are looking for quickly. The website is also user friendly for those who are not already comic fans and has a link to help new users find what they are looking for. I like the section on the right side showing the top 10 comics, this makes it easy to find what the most popular items of the week are. Another cool visual feature of the site is that you can hover over any of the comic books and a button pops up allowing you to purchase the item on the spot. This is a good strategy for the Company as people are more likely to buy the product if it is easy to do so. Overall, I think the site is well designed and the content is displayed in an orderly and strategic manner.
