      Responsive web design term is related to the concept of developing a website design in a manner that helps the lay out to get changed according to the computer screen resolution of the user. Responsive web design (RWD) is a web design approach aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing experience. This means easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling across a wide range of devices from mobile phones to desktop computer monitors.

      <h1 class="section-titles">Fluid Layouts</h1>
      For fluid layouts, dimensions are defined in percentages, and as you might expect, this affords greater malleability and fluidity. In other words, by setting a percentage, you will not have to think about device size or screen width, and consequently, you can find a reasonable solution for each case because the sizing of your design will adapt to the size of the device used. Fluid layouts are closely linked to media queries and special styles for optimization. Percentage based widths alone will likely not be enough to accommodate your design for a large variety of display sizes. The display on mobile devices can be especially difficult to implement using fluid design practices.

        <li>Responsive design allows developers to cater to anyone on any device. Responsive design removes the need for users to zoom and resize content depending on the device they are using. </li>
        <li>The addition of smartphones and tablets to peoples lives has been a great benefit and it is important that web developers take them into consideration when creating products.</li>

      Implementing these concepts was fairly difficult for me to grasp at first. We spent a couple hours just figuring out how to make the media queries work in a few different screen sizes. I think smartphones and tablets have changed web design as designers now have to visualize the display of content on browsers using multiple display sizes and formats. It causes you to think more about how to deliver content in different ways. I think new technologies will keep developers on their toes in implementing the best possible design solutions to deliver content to users. This is a constantly changing and growing field that requires developers and designers to adapt to the technologies that come available. I think visually impaired people use the web using screen reading software that explains the layout of a page and reads through all of the text on a page to the user. Images and presented to visually impaired users through the "alt" provided by the creator. This is why it is important that the creator uses an accurate description or word for the images alts on their web pages. I think it is important to design and develop keeping the visually impaired in mind and doing our best to make our sites easier for them to use. This means making sites with logical and clean layouts, and avoiding the use of cluttered texts.
